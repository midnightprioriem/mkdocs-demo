# Welcome to MkDocs

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).

This site is intended to be a demo site for MkDocs to show what the platform is capable of. There are a number of [Python Markdown extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions) and [MkDocs Plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) that add a great deal of functionality to the site. The specific extensions and plugins showcased on this site are those that I find most useful. Be aware that there is a plethora of other extensions out there not covered by this site that you may wish to explore!

## Markdown Demo
[Markdown demo](markdown.md)

## Python Markdown Extensions
MkDocs uses the [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) Python library to parse markdown files into HTML. The library provides an API for extensions to add additional behavior to the parser. See the [Markdown Extensions](markdown_extensions.md) page for more info on suggested extensions.

## MkDocs Plugins
MkDocs supports adding functionality via plugins. See the [official MkDocs user guide on plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) for more information. This page is intended to be a list of recommended plugins. See the [MkDocs Plugins](plugins.md) page for more info on suggested plugins.
