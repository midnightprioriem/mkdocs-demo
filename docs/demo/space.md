# Space

Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [objects](physical_object.md) and events have relative [position](position_geometry.md) and [direction](orientation_geometry). Physical space is often conceived in three [linear dimensions](dimension.md), although modern [physicists](physics.md) usually consider it, with [time](time.md), to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [continuum](continuum.md) known as [spacetime](spacetime.md). The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [universe](universe.md].
